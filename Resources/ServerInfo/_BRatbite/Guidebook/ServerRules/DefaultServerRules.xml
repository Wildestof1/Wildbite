# Welcome to RatBite!

  This server is designed to let you be free to do whatever you want. While there are many fun situations for people playing or role-playing normally, we're making self-antagonism fun, for both the person doing it and the person targeted by it!

Follow this basic set of rules and whether you're a normal player, a griefer, shitsec, power gamer, or whatever, you'll be welcome to test your limits within the game design with only in-game consequences. Do that which makes the time you spend here a good time!


## SERVER RULES

  - 1. This isn't Goob or Wizden.
  Abandon your preconceptions from other servers. You are free to do whatever you want here, but with in-game consequences. For example: you may use meta information such as antag knowledge and you may do self antagonism. The only exceptions are these basic rules.

  - 2. CC roles specifically MUST follow orders and SoP
  Central Command actively mindshields and monitors its employees through trackers/recorders and controls them through kill switches, so if you choose to play as part of CC (ERT, NTR, BSO,) you MUST read and follow your role’s SOP and orders to the letter. You aren't required to follow them in spirit however, – otherwise known as being ‘Maliciously Compliant’. – Roleban.

  - 3. No terrorism/murder for no reason as command/sec
  As part of the Command or Security personnel you are actively mindshielded but are not monitored like direct employees of CC are. You may act outside the law and abuse your power, but can face in-character repercussions if your actions are witnessed and reported. Basically, as sec/command, do NOT grief the station en-masse or round remove people for no reason. – Warning/Roleban.

  - 4. Metacomms are allowed, unfair metacomm info sharing is not
  No exposing relevant game info you should not know via meta-communications. (discord or other voice chat applications) You may play with friends and share basic information in close proximity within reason, just explain it as just being really in tune with your buddy, but DO NOT speak to your pal from the dead or give vital info over vast distances without a radio. – Warning/Ban.

  - 5. No ghost grudging
  We use a basic New Life Rule. However you may remember past rounds,  so general resentment and metagrudge from past rounds is permitted to keep everyone feeling the social consequences of their actions, BUT do not use knowledge from your previous life/death during the CURRENT round to meta-grudge and impact the round unless directed to by an AHelp message. – Warning/Ban.

  - 6. Don't be a bigoted PoS
  You are allowed to make edgy jokes, say mild slurs in-character, and engage in any degree of in-game speciesism. However, do NOT say real life slurs OOC, use extreme real world slurs with malicious or obnoxious results, ceaselessly harass someone on the basis of their minority status, or bring your genuine biases into the game. The community will make a fool out of you and if your offense was bad enough you will be warned/banned.. – Warning/Ban.

  - 7. No ERP.
  Do not engage in ERP. Romantic RP or ‘E-Dating’ is allowed only if you know the other person and it remains non-graphic, you don’t know their age or the effect these things will have on people if you do not know them personally. – Ban.

  - 8. Follow borg laws/mind control
  Silicons must follow their laws. Similarly, characters who are mind controlled or under similar effects that dictate their behaviour must obey their master and/or laws. Failure to comply will result in your character being treated as defective/uncontrolled and your maker/master will be compensated for their loss. – Warning/Ban.

  - 9. No boring complete station destruction/extreme raiding behavior in the first 15 minutes.
  You may still be a general scumbag and get into fights. Security, command, and CC may still arrest or do whatever they want if they see you acting suspiciously during this period so there’s no real getting around this. – Ban.

  - 10. Keep it in character
  This is a relatively common rule. Don't refer to this being a game, don't mention concepts such as admins or updates, and generally try to be funny in an IC context instead of a meta one. - Warning/Admin Abuse

  - 11. No lying to the admins in Ahelp or appeals
   Making it harder to get to the truth will result in longer bans. -Ban

  - 12. No multikey, cheat software, or raiding.
As an unfortunate requirement of being brigaded due to a controversial start and server vision, we completely disallow general raider behavior in your first 5 hours on our server. After that you must only abide by the other rules. During this trial period, you will still be allowed to do way more than other servers, be a kooky serial killer on the DL, cause ruckus, all that. But specifically, going on NRP murder rampages without a bit of time investment will leave you at the admins' discretion. -Ban 

Though we update often, you might miss something if you don't go see discord for most up to date rules.

## CC SOP and Perma Brig
Getting caught (in character) committing heinous enough crimes will have consequences that reach across rounds. Don't be surprised if you spawn in as a prisoner after horrific criminal behaviors, but you can use this system to your advantage if you learn it.
The Multi-Round Perma Brig guidelines can be found in Legal section of SOP.

As stated in rule 2, playing CC roles such as RSO, NTR, ERT, or BSO signs you up for far more rigid rulings and punishments, read about these rules before ever considering picking any of these roles up.

Guidelines for Central Command can be found in the Jobs section of SOP, be sure to check both your own job's SOP along with Central Command general SOP. Not doing this risks a role ban.
