# Multi-Round Perma Brig Conviction Rulings
These rulings will be the ones that will actually get you sentenced to perma. Remember in all but the most extreme cases you must be witnessed committing the crime by a not dead individual at a point they'd reasonably be able to report it to CC, (exceptions include distro flooding and cameras seeing you) so you're free to be the silent serial killer if you can pull it off.

Generic Crulings (not CERulings) apply only half the sentences if committed by prisoners, assistants, clowns, or mimes.

CRuling 1:
Gross Incompetence. +1:
You chose to play a command role and neglected to/were incapable of fulfill(ing) your department's basic functions.
OR
You chose to play an important role (med, engi, sec) and your failure to even once attempt to perform your basic functions directly resulted in permadeath or station destruction. (See CRuling 4)
Beginner roles are exempt from this ruling.

CRuling 2:
Round Removal. +2:
You intentionally killed and prevented the revival of another. Exceptions such as self defense, department/station defense, and orders from a representative of central command apply. Self defense does not apply if you violate space law or are in possession of contraband.

CRuling 3:
Mass Murder. +2
You killed over 3 people with no intention of reviving them.  Exceptions such as self defense, department/station defense, and orders from a representative of central command apply. Self defense does not apply if you violate space law or possess contraband.

CRuling 4:
Station Destruction. +2:
You directly caused a portion of the station to become uninhabitable without good cause or you rendered a large portion of a department inoperable with no intent to repair it.

CRuling 5:
Terrorism +4:
You engaged in shuttle ramming, AME destruction, loosing, heat/gas flooding, and/or other ways of mass destruction making the station completely unlivable due to outstandingly malicious griefing intent.
This is the one CRuling that requires no proof. If you do any of this without an exceptional excuse, you will go to perma.

CRuling 6:
Mass Destruction. +5:
You, on top of the countless CRulings that must have triggered to get to this point, single handedly (or with a group, in which everyone involved triggers this CRuling) completely destroyed a station to the point evac reasonably needed to be called. This CRuling applies even if there are no remaining witnesses.

Convict Extension Rulings
These rulings can only be triggered by prisoners with an active perma brig sentence.

CERuling 1:
Prison Break. +2:
You violated your sentencing and successfully escaped the perma brig. This charge may not be applied if your own personal safety is at risk within the  confines of the brig.

CERuling 2:
Grand Theft. +2:
You stole an important piece of command equipment (CMO hypospray, RD teleporter, captain Pistol) and failed to return it by the end of the shift

CERuling 3:
Grand Kidnapping.+4:
You abducted and held a member of command, security, or CC against their will for longer than 3 minutes.

CERuling 4:
Ransoming. +4:
You successfully ransommed a crew member in exchange for a valuable item or large sum of spesos. Any item received this way is considered stolen.

CERuling 5:
Parole Violation. +4:
You intentionally violated parole after convincing security to let you out on parole by violating any of the above CRulings or CERulings.

CERuling 6:
Station Pet Massacre. +4:
You killed at least one station pet in every department. As well as Ian and Renault.

CERuling 7:
Bad Announcement. +2:
You made an announcement speaking ill of station personnel, nanotrasen, or central command.

CERuling 8:
Bigotry. +2:
You discriminated against a member of your station's staff on the basis of immutable characteristics. It's never okay, not even in prison.

CERuling 9:
Grievous Bodily Harm. +4:
You brutally maimed someone but left them to be found by medical staff to live with the long-standing and traumatic affects of your actions.

CERuling 10:
Sentencee murder. -2:
You killed your fellow perma brig resident. Good job! Nanotrasen resources are best used elsewhere!

CERuling 11:
Sentencee Murder Victim. -4:
You were unfortunately brutally and illegally murdered (and not brought back) by another prisoner or a rowdy security force. This CERuling does not apply if you started the conflict that led to your death or asked in any way to be executed.

<Box>Feel free to Ahelp people regarding these offenses if you see it. It will help get more convictions. If you choose to mention it, say you reported them to CC.</Box>

Harbor no ill will towards your fellow player for ic actions though. We're all here to have a good time even if in different ways.
