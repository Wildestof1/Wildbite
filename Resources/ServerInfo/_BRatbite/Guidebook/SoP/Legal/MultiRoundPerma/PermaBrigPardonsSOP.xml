# Multi-Round Perma Brig Pardon Rulings
These rulings are the ones that will decrease your perma sentence. Triggering any conviction rulings will invalidate these. Remember to Ahelp the things you did to get your sentence reduced.

Ruling 1:
Served a sentence. -1:
You stayed in your cell and served your whole shift sentence. You may go half ssd but you must be responsive if called on for this to be applied.


Ruling 2:
Excellent parolee. -2 or -3:
You were made a parolee and didn't commit any major crimes. Extra points for outstanding performance. Does not stack with Pardon ruling 1.


Ruling 3:
Outstanding heroism. -5:
You risked your life against dire odds in an effort to protect the station or one of it's personnel. This does not apply to antags, anyone with a standing brig sentence, or someone who has had a brig sentence applied to them before your heroic act.


Ruling 4:
Command voucher. -1:
A command stamped voucher for your release and faxxed it to centcomm.
This can be fabricated but must go unnoticed.
This ruling cannot stack with itself.


Ruling 5:
CC/Captain voucher. -2:
Same as ruling 4 but for Cap and the NTR.
This ruling cannot stack with itself but can stack with ruling 4.
