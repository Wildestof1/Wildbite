# Multi-Round Perma Brig
On this station, when you commit a heinous enough crime and it is witnessed by the general public (or reported provably ic), you will gain a variable number of perma brig sentences.

If you have anything above 0 perma brig sentences, you will be rolebanned from every role except prisoner.

Your perma sentences (or tokens) cannot go below 0 or above 50, though breaching 50 by committing heinous acts despite your starting in perma brig will remove your perma sentence and we will note your accomplishment with a PP point in notes. Both meaning "Prisoner Prestige" and acknowledging that you had to be quite the PP head to get to this point.

PP points unlock you exclusive roundstart items like lv cables, a battery, wood,uranium glass shard, and steel that will make your escape easier roundstart. (As we have not coded this system yet, you may ask for them to be spawned in Ahelp roundstart but no more than 2 minutes in)

As it stands, this is entirely administrator applied. We store and edit your perma brig sentence and PP points in your notes at the end of each round. You may need to Ahelp to get your sentences removed or added.

These are the rulings that will get you sentenced to prison during the next round, each one is meant to represent one shift but your actions during the round will dictate whether you get released early or gain an even longer stay.

Antags will still receive perma briggings, though less severe and they are immune to being jailed for things that further their antag objectives.

Assistants, clowns, and mimes will receive far more lenient and often non existent perma brig sentences. Prisoners will however be fully affected to encourage the parolee/dangerous escaped convict gameplay and consequences.

You will not be locked up if you manage to completely scrub any and all evidence (unless you caused evac singlehandedly). This is meant to enable all sorts of crazy Dexter style serial killer plotlines involving evidence in our rounds.

With the ground rules established, onto the rulings.
