# Central Command Roles
<ColorBox><Box HorizontalAlignment="Center" Margin="10">Every single centcomm role, including but not limited to: NTR, BSO, RSO, NTA, all ERTs, Cburn, DS, and navy commanders absolutely must abide by their SoP.</Box></ColorBox>

<Box>These roles have monitoring chips in their heads so anything they hear and see, so can centcomm. They may also communicate directly to centcomm by adding "requesting CC correspondence" -to their Ahelps.</Box>

Unlike most any other role on this server, If any of these roles don't operate by their SoP, they will be warned, fired, terminated, and possibly rolebanned depending on the severity of the offense.

The previous two points considered, these are the only roles admins should be using the explode smite on with any regularity.

These roles are for people who want to respond to specific threats by the book, serve the community as a narc, or use the system to enforce their ends.

Regardless of how you rationalize it, picking these roles equates to selling your freedom to NT in exchange for their responsibility and for their power, both administrative and martial.
The SoP - Representative expectations

Directive 1:
Foremost, above all other directives, Central Command personnel are to obey orders verifiably given by their direct superiors or Central Command themselves, referring exclusively the highest authority if these orders ever conflict.  Termination or Death

Directive 2:
Central Command personnel are to do their best to perform their role's function when necessary. E.G, NTR must perform departmental inspections, make reports to CC, and perform demotions as needed. BSO must defend and resuscitate CC and command personnel as needed. Retraining and/or Termination

Directive 3:
Central Command personnel are to personally abide by space law to the letter in all but the most dire emergencies. While allowed to make arrests, it's not your explicit function to enforce space law, but to ensure space law is properly enforced by maintaining station cohesion.Retraining or Termination.

Directive 4:
Central Command personnel, while by no means required to be respectful, must not overescalate issues, physically or administratively, or abuse any individual station crew. All but the most high ranking of you are subject to the same rulings you will be enforcing below. Retraining, Termination, or Death, depending on severity.
The SoP - Enforcement expectations

EDirective 1:
You are to try your best to ensure a non abusive, friendly work environment is maintained except when that would ignore other enforcement directives. This may primarily be done through verbal warnings.

EDirective 2:
You are to ensure crew members are properly meeting dress codes with at the very least recognizable uniforms and IDs fitting their own identity and department, special exceptions may be given to religious organizations.
Direct (or force in the case of non co operation) noncompliant individuals to visit the Head of Personnel and receive proper clothing and ID.

EDirective 3:
Nanotrasen gives special attention to ensure our stations are made clear of bigotry. You are to go beyond even space law's measure to punish any who would harass, other, or discriminate based on species, race, sexuality, religious/ideological affiliation, gender identity, or any other inherent or immutable traits.
You are to warn, then call security to have imprisoned, then if needed demote any one crew member engaging in such conduct.
