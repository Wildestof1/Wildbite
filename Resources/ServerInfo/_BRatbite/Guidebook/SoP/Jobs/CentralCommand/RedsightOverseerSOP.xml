This is the list of procedures, responsibilities, and duties of the [color=#1b67a5][bold]Redsight Overseer[/bold][/color] of this station.


<ColorBox>
  <Box HorizontalAlignment="Center" Margin="10">
    The [color=#1b67a5][bold]Redsight Overseer[/bold][/color] is the embodiment of space law on the station, as an individual crew member, a Redsight Overseer answers to the head of security and captain, if there is no head of security, the Redsight Overseer will assume HoS duties (and authorities) as well. The HoS reclaims these privileges and responsibilities on arrival/revival
  </Box>
</ColorBox>


The Redsight Overseer is [bold][color=#fcd12a]THE LAW[/color][/bold] and though normally their subordinate, in instances where the captain or head of security violate space law to a major degree (over 10 minutes maximum sentence), the RSO may deem it appropriate to detain and demote either head and replace them with another crewman at the HoP's or failing that, the RSO's own discretion.


1. Though permitted and outright encouraged to fulfill the functions of a normal security officer, The Redsight Overseer's primary duties are to oversee the security team's conduct, demote members of security and command violating space law, and perform the function of a judge in any station courtroom trials.
<Box>The Redsight Overseer should generally stay in and around security, the brig, command, law rooms, or be tailing members of the security team/command </Box>


2. The Redsight Overseer, unless directly ordered not to by Central Command, must always strive to maintain adherence to space law themselves.


3. The Redsight Overseer is promoted and expected to detain and demote any outright space law abusing members of security on the spot, as well as correct smaller grievances, E.G overlong brig timers and overescalation. Demotions are to be swiftly handed out to any member of security committing crimes that put them above a max brig sentence of 15 minutes. The RSO may also use their own discretion and good faith to demote any space law violating member of security at will, however the HoS has final say unless the HoSâ€™ brig timer would exceed 10 minutes




4. Though still bound by overall CC SoP rulings regarding not being needlessly abusive toward normal station crew, special exception to both space law and SoP is given to the RSO to abuse and humiliate underperforming members of the security team as well as any one individual who has provably (or witnessed by the RSO to have) committed a crime and not yet fully served their sentence. However, this righteous abuse of power may not escalate to round removal or indefinite detainment unless space law allows it.
<Box>Examples include public dressdowns, time out chairs, and generally abusive language. Bigotry is still not permitted.</Box>


5. The Redsight Overseer is to be available to lawyers for appeals whenever possible. They must keep an eye on their radio/nanochats for summons or generally be present in areas the lawyer would have access to. The RSO will always properly listen to and review the evidence regarding appeals made regarding any arrest if at all possible.


6. The Redsight Overseer is expected to, either personally or through delegation, see to the apprehension of any sufficiently space law violating member of security or command. It is understood that hunting rogue security can be a dangerous undertaking, but Redsight Overseers are equipped to perform this function and selected from only the best and bravest of security personnel. Cowardice is not an option.
<Box>This does not mean an RSO may not take a more diplomatic or underhanded approach to the apprehension of criminals.</Box>


7. The Redsight Overseer is not required or expected to oversee every single arrest on the station. Being present and collecting the facts personally is a great boon to serving space law, but the arrestee, their lawyers, and the arresting officer are expected to do this job for the RSO while the RSO is handling other appeals, personally catching criminals, or performing disciplinary actions.


8. The Redsight Overseer functions as the station's judge. Any permanent brig conviction or execution appeals are to be taken to the station's courtroom, or failing that, the service department by the RSO. Along with the captain, the RSO may approve and oversee executions. However the RSO must attempt to broadcast their intention to execute the detainee over command radio first.
<Box>YOU. ARE. THE. LAW!!! </Box>
