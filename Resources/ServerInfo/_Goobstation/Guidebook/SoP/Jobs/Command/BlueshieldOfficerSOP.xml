Blueshield Officer (BSO) SOP
This is the list of procedures, responsibilities, and duties of the [color=#1b67a5][bold]Blueshield Officer[/bold][/color] of this station.

<ColorBox>
  <Box HorizontalAlignment="Center" Margin="10">
    The [color=#1b67a5][bold]Blueshield Officer[/bold][/color] should never be Captain nor Head of Staff.
  </Box>
</ColorBox>

The [bold][color=#fcd12a]most important[/color][/bold] rule of the Blueshield Officer is to protect and maintain the lives of Command personnel on the station.
<Box>Command personnel are personnel hired by Nanotrasen (confirmed personnel in command) and any Central Command officials (including NTR).</Box>

Protect the operating command personnel and your protectorate
Your primary job as Blueshield is to protect the heads of staff (Mindshielded individuals actively employed in a command role), and above all else, your protectorate (the one your objective is to protect) even at the cost of your safety or that of non-command personnel. However, protection does not permit reckless endangerment to the general crew. You don’t have to obey all orders by station command, and you may defend yourself or others if a head becomes violent. If you must incapacitate a command member, stabilize them medically and report the incident to the Captain, NTR, or Central Command for further action. In the event none of those people are present on the station, or CC is unresponsive, use discretion but understand you will be held accountable for your decision.

You must obey your protectorate in all but the most unreasonable circumstances, you may not violate your CC SoP to serve your protectorate's directives unless they are a ranking officer of Central Command (minimum NTR or RSO). Your protectorate may assign you to any one new protectorate who will then assume the authorities of the previous.

You are not part of Security, nor are you their subordinate.
As BSO, you are expected to follow space law, but not enforce it. This is considered significantly below your pay grade and a waste of Nanotrasen resources. You are authorized to arrest individuals if their illegal actions present a credible threat to the personnel you are expected to protect. Exception to this rule is granted if you are explicitly authorized by your protectorate to go off and perform security duties on your own.

Lethal force is a last resort
Due to the advanced weaponry and training offered to you by Nanotrasen, You should always exhaust all less-than-lethal options before risking the lives of your co-workers. Clones and jumpsuits are expensive, so killing someone who is not posing an immediate and active deadly threat is a waste of Nanotrasen resources.


Respect chain of command.
As an employee of Centcomm, you are on a separate chain of command from the station’s command personnel. In the event of a revolution, mutiny, demotions, or any other scenario in which command personnel have confrontations of any kind with other command personnel, you are expected to aid and protect the highest-ranking command member, even if your protectorate's interests and orders don't align with this rule.


Work with  Central Command
Since you represent higher command, you are expected to ensure station operations align with Nanotrasen’s interests. If you observe command personnel engaging in conduct that violates their contract or harms the station but does not pose a direct and immediate threat to yourself or other command staff, you are required to report this to the NTR, or directly to Central Command if the NTR is unavailable, and follow their next orders to the letter. In the event that you hold grievances with the NTR’s orders, carry them out but immediately afterwards, communicate your concerns directly to CC.
